# notes
- document database
- all data is stored in json like objects -> stored in collections that can be queried
- allows data to be frequently accessed to be grouped together
- database is easier to horizontally scale via sharding
    - sharding
- new document has an object id
    - unique to that collection
    - can define multiple fields which correspond to different data types
- to make access faster
    - secondary indices can be made
- aggregation pipeline can be made
- document-oriented, noSQL database
    - document based: represents hierarchical relationship using a single record
    - schema free: lesser data migrations
- data is stored in documents with key-value pairs
    - converts json to binary format
    - all documents are stored in a collection
    - these collections are stored in the MongoDB database

# how does no-sql work?
- relational databases can scale vertically not horizontally
    - vertical scaling: add more floors
    - horizontal scaling: add more buildings
- no-sql get rid of relationships and as such, stands on its own
    - key-value stores
- primary key
    - key allows us to pick which partition contains data
    - primary key is converted to hash value
    - this allows us to choose where to store the item
    - put everthing on a single server
    - the range of the hash of the key: keyspace
- schema-less
- big collections and have small documents
